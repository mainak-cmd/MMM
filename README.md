The purpose of the marketing mix is to find the right combination of products, prices, promotions, and distribution (place) so that a company can gain and maintain an advantage over competitors. The project aims to determine the amount of promotion that is required for a product based on the total amount of stock present and also consumer sentiment. For example, if a product name Hornby 2014 Catalogue has positive sentiments based on consumer reviews as well as affordable, in the future, it will have comparatively fewer stocks than other products, so the product does not require more funds for promotion as it is already popular.on the other hand, if the same product has negative sentiment and but the price is affordable it will require funds for quality management as well as promotion. Thus by understanding the stock movement based on customer reviews and product prices we can easily determine the right combination of products, prices, promotions, and distribution (place).
